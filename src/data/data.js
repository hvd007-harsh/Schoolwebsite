    principleQuote:`“In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.” -   `,
    principleMessage:`
    In her quote, Mother Teresa very powerfully captures important wisdom about how to approach life and schooling to make it more fulfilling and significant.  Teaching and learning offers us all numerous opportunities to focus on a number of “small things” that culminate over time to produce students who are prepared to do the “great things” of life.  Keeping this in mind the Jeevandhara Convent School is launching into the digital revolution that will transform every aspect of student life in the classrooms and outside. It will also contribute to the realization of the school shaping education through digital vision and to move from the traditional way of communicating to the digital system. The closed classroom is opened as the school goes online. The teachers and students can with pride reveal the work done within the four walls.
    Education is one of the means to transmit the light of life and spread the radiance of it in the ambience in which we live. Inspired by the teachings of Jesus and our Patron saint St Angela Merici and with our Motto "Let Your Light Shine" we aim at the integral development of each student under the banner of Jeevandhara Convent School and lay a lot of impetus on honing every aspect of child's personality that works towards nurturing the child in to a happy and well equipped human being.
    The school has its clear vision and mission objective. In order to accomplish our vision and mission, we take as much effort as possible. We believe that education is an effective medium of social transformation. We get encouragement, looking at bright and successful careers of our thousands of students, who subsequently benefit the society. We feel proud that we are part of such an institute, which is shaping the future citizens.
    Our school cares for the individual development of each and every student. We accord prime importance to the behavioral discipline, moral integrity and cognitive developments of our students. Our teachers strive to teach not only academic programmes but also life skills needed for students’ self development with highly resourceful faculty.
    The reputation, the school has acquired and established over these years is due to the dedication and selfless commitment of teachers, supporting staff, and the students. With the support of the staff and families, our students explore, express and excel academically and creatively. I appreciate the dedication and the selfless service of the teachers of the past and the present and wish them all, best of fortune, peace and prosperity for their contribution to the noble task of spreading education and its manifest qualities, aims and objectives.
    Wishing you all the best`,

About:[{
    text:`A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university. In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods. Non-government schools, also known as private schools,[3] may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools.
    Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives,[4] of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others,[5] of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity,[6] and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn.[7]
    In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building, respectively. Schools are organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.`
