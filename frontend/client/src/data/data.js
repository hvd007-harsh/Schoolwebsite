    principleMessage:`
    In her quote, Mother Teresa very powerfully captures important wisdom about how to approach life and schooling to make it more fulfilling and significant.  Teaching and learning offers us all numerous opportunities to focus on a number of “small things” that culminate over time to produce students who are prepared to do the “great things” of life.  Keeping this in mind the Jeevandhara Convent School is launching into the digital revolution that will transform every aspect of student life in the classrooms and outside. It will also contribute to the realization of the school shaping education through digital vision and to move from the traditional way of communicating to the digital system. The closed classroom is opened as the school goes online. The teachers and students can with pride reveal the work done within the four walls.

    Education is one of the means to transmit the light of life and spread the radiance of it in the ambience in which we live. Inspired by the teachings of Jesus and our Patron saint St Angela Merici and with our Motto "Let Your Light Shine" we aim at the integral development of each student under the banner of Jeevandhara Convent School and lay a lot of impetus on honing every aspect of child's personality that works towards nurturing the child in to a happy and well equipped human being.
    
    The school has its clear vision and mission objective. In order to accomplish our vision and mission, we take as much effort as possible. We believe that education is an effective medium of social transformation. We get encouragement, looking at bright and successful careers of our thousands of students, who subsequently benefit the society. We feel proud that we are part of such an institute, which is shaping the future citizens.
    
    Our school cares for the individual development of each and every student. We accord prime importance to the behavioral discipline, moral integrity and cognitive developments of our students. Our teachers strive to teach not only academic programmes but also life skills needed for students’ self development with highly resourceful faculty.
    
    The reputation, the school has acquired and established over these years is due to the dedication and selfless commitment of teachers, supporting staff, and the students. With the support of the staff and families, our students explore, express and excel academically and creatively. I appreciate the dedication and the selfless service of the teachers of the past and the present and wish them all, best of fortune, peace and prosperity for their contribution to the noble task of spreading education and its manifest qualities, aims and objectives.
    
    Wishing you all the best`,
